    "# Working with Larger Datasets with a Scalable Solution!\n",
    "Consider the size of the datasets you have worked with at Uni. Probably a few hundred megabytes or a couple gigabytes. Whilst `pandas` and `Excel` do have their use cases, it is not feasible to use them when you work with larger datasets over several gigabytes. You have been working with moderately sized data. In this subject, you will be working with larger datasets (not quite big data).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "1. 20k rows would be hard for Excel, but easy for `pandas`.\n",
    "2. A few million records would be doable for `pandas` depending on RAM (let's say 16GB or 32GB to be generous).\n",
    "3. Now, consider 100 million rows over several gigabytes. `pandas` **is not your solution**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "`pandas` works in-memory. That is, you are limited by RAM which can be hard to come across for the average person. Even with 32GB or 64GB memory, it is best to use Apache Spark, which is designed to work with large datasets.\n",

    "    - If not same path, change the kernel of your jupyter notebook to using that python kernel.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. The java instance stopped when executing the cell\n",
    "    - Ensure java is installed (commands executes without error)\n",
    "    - make sure `echo $JAVA_HOME` produces the proper location (i.e. it points at where your java is installed)\n",

    "3. `conda`, `pip`, `apt`, `brew`... not found!\n",
    "    - Install the required softwares and make sure their home folder are present in your `echo $PATH`\n",

    "Parquet:\n",
    "- `parquet` on the other hand is stored in columns and (ELI5) are very efficient with data formats.\n",
    "- For example, a single row in a `csv` can contain several different data types. \n",
    "- `parquet` just have the single data type per column, allowing compression algorithms to be applied to reduce disk space and read efficiency.\n",

    "- Scenario: Student does analysis on `tip_amount` and finds several `NULL` values and either drops them or includes it in the analysis. Later on, they use a regression model to predict this value.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Result: According to the data dictionary, `tip_amount` is automatically populated for credit card tips (`payment_type` is `1`). Cash tips are not included. This means that the students' analysis included all payment types despite this field clearly specifying the rule. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Penalty: The student will lose marks on the analysis section. The modelling section will be marked _assuming_ they got this filtering method correct. However, if another issue pops up due to this, there will be another penalty applied. Please get this right!\n",
    "\n",
    "- Solution: Student should filter for only `payment_type=1` and now, the student can (hopefully) conduct correct analysis on `tip_amount`.\n",
    "\n",
